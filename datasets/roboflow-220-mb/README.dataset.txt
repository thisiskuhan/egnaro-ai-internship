# About This Dataset

The Roboflow `Website Screenshots` dataset is a synthetically generated dataset composed of screenshots from over 1000 of the world's top websites. They have been automatically annotated to label the following classes:
:fa-spacer:
* `button` - navigation links, tabs, etc.
* `heading` - text that was enclosed in `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
* `link` - inline, textual `<a>` tags.
* `label` - text labeling form fields.
* `text` - all other text.
* `image` - `<img>`, `<svg>`, or `<video>` tags, and icons.
* `iframe` - ads and 3rd party content.

## Example

This is an example image and annotation from the dataset:

## Usage

Annotated screenshots are very useful in Robotic Process Automation. But they can be expensive to label. This dataset would cost over $4000 for humans to label on popular labeling services. We hope this dataset provides a good starting point for your project. Try it with [a model from our model library](https://models.roboflow.ai).

## Collecting Custom Data

Roboflow is happy to provide a custom screenshots dataset to meet your particular needs. We can crawl public or internal web applications. Just [reach out](https://roboflow.ai/contact) and we'll be happy to provide a quote!
